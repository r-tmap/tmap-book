Introduction
- Maps in genaral
- R spatial
- Grammar of graphics

  
Geographic data in R (similar to geocomprC2, but different accents)
- What is geographic data? (points/lines/polygons/rasters, projection on earth (CRS))
- sf
- stars


Methodology: how to make good maps?
- Which information to show? (absolute vs relative values, global overview vs local detail, required geographical detail, base maps or not, user- and task-dependency)
- Aesthetics (position, shape, size, area, etc; for which data / perception ranking)
- Colors (color spaces, perception, guidelines)
- Common methods (choropleth / bubble map / cartogram etc)

Basics of tmap
- Layered approach (grammar of graphics)
- qtm
- plot and view mode

Specifying the data with tm_shape
- projection (CRS, is.main)
- bounding box
- simplification?
- raster: downsample etc

Geospatial data
- tm_shape
- CRS
- bounding box

Layers
- aesthetics (overview)
- points
- polygons
- lines
- raster
- text


Facets
- How to define facets?
- Scales
- Coordinates


Map enhancements
- map attributes (compass, scale bar, etc)
- aspect ratio, position of legends etc


View mode:
- set zoom level, panning, etc
- popups
- leaflet base/overlay-layers/groups


Tmap options
- Styles



Output
- static images (png etc)
- interactive maps (HTML files)
- RMarkdown
- Shiny
