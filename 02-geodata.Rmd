# Geographic data in R {#geodata}
<!-- or spatial data? -->

<!-- \index{R!installation} -->

## Introduction

<!-- - few introduction sections -->
<!-- - mention GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS -->
<!-- - references to the next sections -->
<!-- - maybe also references to some books (either here or in the next section or both) -->

## Vector data

<!-- - one/two intro sentences -->
<!-- - including r packages used for vector representation -->

### Vector data model

<!-- - what is the vector data model (point coordinates) -->
<!-- - examples -->
<!-- - what's the simple features standard -->
<!-- - main geometry types -->
<!-- - relation between geometries and attributes -->
<!-- - vector file formats -->

### The sf package

<!-- - how the sf objects are organized -->
<!-- - how to read sf objects from files -->
<!-- - where to find info on how to operate on sf objects -->
<!-- - https://geocompr.github.io/ -->
<!-- - vector simplification? -->
<!-- - stars proxy -->

## Raster data

<!-- one/two intro sentences -->
<!-- including r packages used for raster representation -->

### Raster data model

<!-- - raster data model (grid) -->
<!-- - contionous and categorical rasters -->
<!-- - examples -->
<!-- - single layer rasters vs multilayer rasters -->
<!-- - storing bands vs attributes (either here or in the next section) (data cubes) -->
<!-- - rbg rasters -->
<!-- - regular, rotated, sheared, rectilinear and curvilinear rasters -->
<!-- - raster file formats -->

### The stars package

<!-- - how the stars objects are organized -->
<!-- - how to read stars objects from files -->
<!-- - including reading chunks, changing resolution, and selecting bands -->
<!-- - where to find info on how to operate on stars objects -->
<!-- - https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/index.html -->
<!-- - advice: sometimes/often it is better to prepare spatial object before the mapping, than trying to over-customize the map -->
<!-- - stars proxy -->
